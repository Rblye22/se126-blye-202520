# PROGRAM PROMPT: utilize the got_emails.csv file. Store the file data into 1D parallel lists, then use the information in the lists to assign additional data to each employee. Use the tables below to assign each employee in the file a unique email address, a department, and a unique phone extension. When you are complete, display the following data for each employee (first name, last name, department, email, and phone extension) to the user. Once you have completed populating all eight parallel lists and displaying the five required back to the user, create and write the following data for each employee to a file named westeros.csv: first name, last name, email, department, and phone extension. Once the file is ready, close it and alert the user via a displayed message. Also tell them how many employees are in the file, and the total count of employees for each department.
