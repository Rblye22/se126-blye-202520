# PROGRAM PROMPT: Build a personal library search system using the file book_list.csv. Store the file data into 1D parallel lists, then use the appropriate searching algorithms for the menu system options. When your user runs any of the options 1 â€“ 7, show all data associated with the search [Library Number, Title, Author, Genre, Page count, Status]. Do not allow the program to end unless the user chooses option 8 to exit. All searches should not be case sensitive.

# VARIABLE DICTIONARY:
# libNum = libary number
# title = book title
# author = author of the book
# genre = genre of book (ex. horror)
# pages = number of pages in the book
# status = status if the book is on loan or available
# temp = temp place holder for sorting 
# listname = list name used for swapping data to organize
# search_type = type of search the user chooses
# search_aut = search by name of author
# search_gen = search by genre
# search_num = search by libary number
